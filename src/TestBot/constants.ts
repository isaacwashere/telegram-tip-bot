export const TEST_START_MESSAGE = `Hi! I'm the TestBot. If you're seeing this then you've properly added your Telegram API token to your .env file and you're ready to get started testing. Since we're using the Telegraf package, I recommend checking out https://telegraf.js.org/ and even the Telegram API Docs https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#available-methods as well for info on what you can do. 

For now, this bot does the exact same thing as the CalculateTipBot, it calculates a tip based on the given amount. Have fun building around that!
