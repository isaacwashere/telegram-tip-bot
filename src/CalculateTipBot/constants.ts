export const CALCULATE_TIP_START_MESSAGE = `Hi! I'm the CalculateTipBot!\n\nIf you give me how much your meal cost, like $3.47, I'll let you know how much the tip will be, and what your total is, from 15% all the way to 50%.\n\nNo need to do the mental math, or pull out a calculator, the CalculateTipBot is at your service. Happy Tipping!\n\nAlso, since my server and I have quite a few guests, and I never stop working, we may try to catch a nap during our down time. If you don't immediately get a response to your amount, just give me a nudge with /wake and I'll let you know if I'm back in.
